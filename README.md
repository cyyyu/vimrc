## Handy shortcuts

Below are the shortcuts that I use everyday, where `<leader>` has been binded to `,`.

* `<leader>f` fzf search.
* `<leader>v` reveal current find in NERDTree, short for `:NERDTreeFind`.
* `<leader>w` short for `:w`.
* `<leader>tn` new tab.
* `<leader>tc` close current tab.
* `<leader>qq` short for `:q`.
* `<leader>p` prettier format, only available when prettier is installed globally.
* `<leader>m` go to definition, short for `ALEGoToDefinition`.
* `<leader>l` next buffer, short for `:bn`.
* `<leader>s` git blame
* `<leader>qo` (in quickfix window)open the file
